# Chomp Node

Node.js wrapper for [Chomp](https://chompbuild.com)

Usable via your favourite JS package manager:

```
npm install -g chomp
```

Chomp should then be usable as a CLI through npm:

```
chomp --version
```

Note: Installing Chomp via `cargo install chompbuild` is the recommended Chomp installation workflow for performance, or via [downloading the binaries into your path](https://github.com/guybedford/chomp/releases).
